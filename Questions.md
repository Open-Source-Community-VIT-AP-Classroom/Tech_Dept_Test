## Q1:
Write A Program to identify in a Gathering of 'N' Persons If there is a person who doesn't know anyone. On the Contrary, all the persons in the gathering should know him.  
Consider The following **Test case:**  
**Input Matrix:**  

{ {0,0,1,0},  
 {0,0,1,0},  
 {0,0,0,0},  
 {0,0,1,0} }  
 
 Now the Output You should Get is: **2**
## Q2:

There can be N pairs of petrol pumps in a range of 80kms of two companies, HP and Indian Oil (IO) arranged alternatively. Now Rearrange them in continuous order, picking up a pair each time.  
Test Case:  
Let n=4 (Number of pairs of Hp and Io)  
We will now arrange them in alternating order:  
Input order:  
Hp Io Hp Io Hp Io Hp Io  
=>  
Output Order:    
Hp Hp Hp Hp Io Io Io Io  (need to take them in pairwise only)

## Q1:  
**Use Java to Solve this Question**  
A particular application may require you to keep track of fish and other inhabitants of the ocean. You might have a Shark class, a Tuna class, a Porpoise class. Any behaviours that are common to several classes of animals should be specified in a superclass and inherited by its subclasses. For instance, all animals eat. So you could have an Animal superclass that declares a method for eating. Animal should be an abstract class, since any concrete animal you create will be of a specific animal subclass. There are two kinds of animals, those that move around in the ocean and those that do not. It makes sense to abstract the behaviour of Swimming for a subclass of Animals. So you could have an abstract subclass of the Animal class. Note that the Swimmer class does not have to code the eat method, since Swimmer is abstract. But any concrete class (i.e., a class that you want to create an instance of) that extends Swimmer must implement both eat and swim. Implement the java program for this scenario with the appropriate data members and member functions.  

**Output:**  

The Shark is Swimming  
The Shark eats Humans  
The Tuna is Swimming  
The Tuna eats seaweed  
The porpoise is Swimming  
The porpoise eats small fishes  

## Q2: 
**Use Python to Solve this Question**  
Define a new exception, called ExceptionLineTooLong, that prints out the error message "The String is Too Long". Write a program that reads all user entered string message and throws a exception of type ExceptionLineTooLong in the case where a string is longer than 80 Characters. Handle aslo all exceptions, that could be thrown by the program.  

**Sample Output:**

Please Enter a String:  
OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP OSC-VITAP   
The Sting is Too Long
